# 🚀 AI-Powered Skill Categorization System

This project automates skill categorization using **Machine Learning and Generative AI**. It first applies **ML models** to categorize known skills, then uses **LLMs** to cluster and categorize unrecognized skills dynamically, and finally generates column names using **Generative AI**.
